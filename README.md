# Library Management System

The Library Management System is a simple software application that allows you to manage books, members, and book lending in a library. It provides essential features such as registering new books, registering new members, lending books to registered members, returning books, and generating reports of issued books and available books.

## Features

- **Register New Books**: Library staff can register new books by providing details such as book title, author, ISBN, and other relevant information.
- **Register New Members**: The system allows staff to register new members by capturing their personal details, such as name, contact information, and membership ID.
- **Lend Books**: Registered members can borrow books from the library. The system enables staff to record the book lending transaction, associating the member and the book.
- **Return Books**: When members return the borrowed books, the staff can mark the books as returned in the system, updating the availability status.
- **List Report of Issued Books**: The system provides a report that lists all the books currently issued to members, helping staff keep track of borrowed books.
- **List Report of Available Books**: The system generates a report that displays all the books currently available in the library, allowing staff to identify available resources.
